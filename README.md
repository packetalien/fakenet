# Fakenet Project

## Overview
The Fakenet project is designed to build a fake internet environment in the cloud using Terraform. This environment is created to simulate various internet services for testing and educational purposes. The project includes fake Indicators of Compromise (IOC) delivery, fake Apache servers, fake email services, and is driven by PowerDNS. This project aims to make building a fake internet or fake cyber range environment easy. Having done this by hand a few times, the idea was to automate the problem away.

Please send any and all feedback to @packetmonk

We are laaaaazer focused on PowerDNS with the goal of API interaction for easy of updates. That's FIRST!, more to follow.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed (This was LLM generated, we will grow it as we discover things that make us say "Oh <expletive>, I forgot that":
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- An account with Microsoft Azure
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Basic knowledge of DNS, Apache, and email servers

## Getting Started

These steps are basic, cause we are just getting started, gas / battery / hydrogen efficiency may vary here.
### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fakenet.git
cd fakenet
```

### Initialize Terraform
Initialize the Terraform working directory and install the required plugins.
```sh
terraform init
```

### Configure Variables
Create a `terraform.tfvars` file to configure your variables. Here’s an example:
```hcl
resource_group_name = "fakenet-resources"
location            = "East US"
admin_username      = "adminuser"
admin_password      = "Password1234!"
```

### Deploy FakeDNS
Apply the Terraform configuration to deploy the FakeDNS server.
```sh
terraform apply
```
Confirm the execution by typing `yes`.

## Project Structure
Here's a brief overview of the project structure:
```
fakenet/
├── main.tf          # Main Terraform configuration file
├── variables.tf     # Variable definitions
├── output.tf        # Output definitions
├── modules/
│   ├── fakedns/     # Module for FakeDNS setup
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── variables.tf
│   │   ├── outputs.tf
```

## FakeDNS Module
The FakeDNS module sets up a PowerDNS server on Debian 11. It configures the necessary DNS zones and makes the server accessible from the internet on port 53 (TCP/UDP).

### Configuration
Customize the DNS zones by modifying the `zones` variable in `modules/fakedns/variables.tf`.

```hcl
variable "zones" {
  description = "List of DNS zones"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["example.com", "test.com"]
}
```

### TODO
- [ ] Implement fake IOC delivery
- [ ] Set up fake Apache servers
- [ ] Configure fake email services
- [ ] Integrate Palo Alto Networks NGFW firewall
- [ ] Add detailed documentation for each module
- [ ] Create test cases for the fake services
- [ ] Optimize Terraform scripts for scalability
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
